Dear <Name>,

Thank you for contacting Ancestry in regards to your information. We are of course, happy to help and to provide more information.
 
There is an option to unsubscribe from all standard emails via your account options on our website, please see more information here:

However, if you unsubscribe from all emails, you will still receive account-related emails, including emails containing payment, security, and legal information. And without deleting the account or updating the email address, unfortunately we cannot control these specific emails being sent out.
 
Ancestry users also have the ability to delete their account by visiting their account and following the steps laid out in the following support article: https://support.ancestry.co.uk/s/article/UK-Deleting-Your-Ancestry-Account. 
 
Ancestry users also have the ability to make a Subject Access Request automatically by visiting their account and requesting a download of their account data. Please see below support article: https://support.ancestry.co.uk/s/article/UK-Requesting-a-Download-of-Your-Account-Data
 
If this is in relation to deleting any public records for yourself from our site, we are sensitive to privacy concerns for living individuals and review removal requests on behalf of living persons, their immediate spouses, and their minor children, and if applicable, we remove content at our discretion.
 
We would be happy to review the situation further. However, we need more information to do so. Please send us the following so we may revisit your request:
 
                Your information as it appears exactly on our website.
                The URL address where your information is found on our website.
 
Even if you do not have a subscription, you should be able to see the search results so even if you cannot view the actual record, can you please send us a screenshot of the record you see in the search results.
 
If you have any questions regarding this or any other matters pertaining to Ancestry, please do not hesitate to contact us by responding to this email. 
 
Sincerely,
